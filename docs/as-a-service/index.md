You can integrate MapIt directly into your own websites and apps without having to set up your own MapIt instance!

mySociety runs **two public MapIt instances** — one with global boundary data from OpenStreetMap, and one with more detailed UK boundary data from the ONS.

Their APIs and licensing requirements are documented at:

* MapIt UK: <http://mapit.mysociety.org>
* MapIt Global: <http://global.mapit.mysociety.org>

Both MapIt instances are free of charge for non-profit low volume use, such as by registered UK charities or individuals working unpaid on non-profit projects.

If you don’t fit into these non-profit cases, or you need to make more than 50,000 calls a year, you will need to get a license. Email the mySociety team at <enquiries@mysociety.org> with details of your expected volumes, and they will let you know the costs.
